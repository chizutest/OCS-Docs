Getting Started with Remote Operations Monitoring
=================================================

OSIsoft Cloud Services (OCS) makes it possible to monitor remote assets in real
time. The immediate access to data about the status of assets gives you the
ability to anticipate problems and proactively perform preventative maintenance.

For example, a fleet manager of a mining truck dealer sells trucks to companies
worldwide. His company provides monitoring and maintenance services to their
customers. With remote monitoring, he reviews the status of the trucks each day,
identifies trucks with problems, uses the data collected on different
measurements to identify possible causes, reviews the history of these
measurements over time, and shares the information with colleagues in the field
who can follow up on the problem.
