# Data Ingress and OSIsoft Message Format

You use OSIsoft Message Format (OMF) to achieve high-throughput asynchronous data ingress into the Sequential Data Store. The following terms are useful for understanding the information
in this and subsequent sections:

- A producer of OMF messages needs a *Client* identity to authenticate and send messages.
- Messages are sent to a queue called a *Topic*.
- A *Subscription* receives messages from a Topic and writes them to the Sequential Data Store.
